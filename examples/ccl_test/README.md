# Test of nga2's Connected Component Labeling (CCL) algorithm

- Randomly distributed spheres represented using a distance level set G are used to create structures for CCL to identify.
- CCL returns a unique global index for each structure, along with an unstructured map for calculating structure-based quantities.
