# Statistically stationary mixing layer problem

This case solves the forced Navier-Stokes equations for the velocity fluctuations that arise for an imposed mean mixing layer flow profile $$\overline{u}(y)=tanh(y/2)/2$$, as described in [Dhandapani, C. & Blanquart, G. 2020 From isotropic turbulence in triply periodic cubic domains to sheared turbulence with inflow/outflow. PRF 5, 124605](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.5.124605).
