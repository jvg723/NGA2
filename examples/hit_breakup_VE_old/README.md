# Break-up of a Droplet in Homogeneous-Isotropic-Turbulence

- The density ratio is kept equal to unity.
- The viscosity ratio is variable.
- The specific quantities to set in the `input` file are:
    - `Droplet diameter`, `position`, and `injection time` (which is expressed in terms of eddy-turnover times)
    - The `Weber number`, defined as in [Risso, F. & Fabre, J. 1998 Oscillations and breakup of a bubble immersed in a turbulent field. J. Fluid Mech. 372, 323â€“355](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112098002705)
$$\mathrm{We} = \dfrac{2 \rho \epsilon^{2/3} d^{5/3}}{\sigma}$$

    - The `Reynolds number` *(optional)* based on the Taylor microscale $\lambda$, defined as
$$\mathrm{Re_\lambda}=\dfrac{\mathrm{U_rms}\lambda}{\nu}$$

        - If not specified, $\mathrm{Re}_\lambda$ will be chosen as the maximum value allowed by the number of grid points.
