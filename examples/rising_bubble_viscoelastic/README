This is the case of a gas bubble rising in a viscoelastic liquid based upon the experimental work of Pilz and Brenn (2007). The case uses a translating reference frame attached to the bubble. The ePTT viscoelastic constitutive model is used for elastic the stress field. The log conformation stablizaiton method is used for the streching and distrion terms and a semi-analytical integration expression is used for the relaxation function. The python script was used to fit the ePTT model parameters using the experimentally obtained shear-rate viscosity curve for the aqueous 0.8% weight P2500 solution.
