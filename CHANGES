Release notes.

January 2018 - Start of development: updated libraries and compilation strategy

October 2020 - Restarting development to get a first flow solver

January 2021 - Constant density, variable density, and multiphase flow solvers
have been completed. Constant and variable density scalar solvers are done, as
well as a VOF solver. First open source release on github of NGA2 on January 16.

April 2021 - Large-eddy simulation modeling has been implemented. An internal
parallel coupler has been implemented, so multi-block simulations are now fully
supported. Lagrangian particle tracking has been added.

March 2022 - Compressible multiphase solver added by Michael Kuhn.

April 2023 - Major updates including immersed boundaries, fft solvers, updated
particles and VOF, new peridynamics solver, new strategy for multi-domain simulations.
